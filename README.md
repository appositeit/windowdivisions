# Window Divisions

When you tile a window and it fills half your screen on your ultrawide monitor
does that seem just a bit annoying? Fear not, this extension lets you define
how many "divisions" you want on the screen, then shift your window across
the divisions. So if you set the divisions to 3, then on the first shortcut
press, your window will fill the leftmost third of the screen. On the second
it will fill the middle third, and on the next key press it will fill the
rightmost third of the screen.

But wait! There's more! If you have to monitors it will continue to cycle
across the next monitor going on to the left most third of the second monitor
and so on. Magic!

It's stupid, but it works!
